h4. Usage

The plugin register the @QuercusServlet@ to process PHP files.

You have to put your PHP files under @src/main/webapps@ for the Servlet to find them.

The plugin does not (yet) provide any magic to allow the PHP scripts to use the Grails @dataSource@,
so you will have to manage the database connection manually.
